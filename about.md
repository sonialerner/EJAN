## Our Mission

Environmental Justice Action Network (EJAN) exists to ensure that all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, have equal protection from environmental harms and equal access to environmental benefits.

## Our Vision

We envision thriving, healthy communities where every person has clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, and a voice in decisions that affect their environment.

## Our Values

### Community-Centered Approach
We believe that the communities most affected by environmental injustice are best positioned to lead the fight for solutions.

### Intersectional Justice
We recognize that environmental issues are deeply connected to social, economic, and racial justice.

### Grassroots Power
We build power from the ground up, supporting community leaders and local organizing efforts.

### Collaborative Action
We work in partnership with other organizations, government agencies, and stakeholders to achieve systemic change.

## Our History

Founded in 2020, EJAN emerged from a coalition of students at George Washington University.
