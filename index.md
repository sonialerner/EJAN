**EJAN** is a grassroots organization dedicated to ensuring that all communities, regardless of race, income, or geographic location, have equal access to a healthy environment and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making processes.

### What We Do

We work at the intersection of social justice and environmental protection, focusing on communities that have been disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. Through volunteering, policy and advocacy, and research, we strive to create lasting change.
